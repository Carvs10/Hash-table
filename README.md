## 1. Intorduction

The Class HashTbl is a series of functions that conect keys with value wich you are looking for.
Also, you can use all the methods that normal class Hashtable from std has.
This project was developed following instructions and orientations given by Prof. Selan Rodrigues dos Santos.
By building this, we want to see how works a class and all its methods developing them by ourselves.

## 2. The Algorithms

We developed all the implementation based on problems described at `projeto_hashtable.pdf` file.

## 3. Compilling

To compile this project, you need to:

`open your terminal`

`open the directory containing the folder Hash-table`

`mkdir build`

`cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..`

`make`

## 4. Running the Tests

` ./run_tests`

## 5. Authorship

This C++ class was developed by [Jo√£o Victtor Carvalho](https://github.com/carvs10) and [Pedro Henrique Alves Cardoso](https://github.com/pedrocardoso5)
